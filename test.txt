Finally, what if a crazy punctuation sequence ...!!? happens here? Combine it all (low, 99999999) and you'll surely get (cap, -99999) an error or crash.


Here's a tricky one: what happens when (hex) has 1F (hex, 10000) or 1010 (bin, -10)?


Lastly, here is a challenge: 1F (hex) and 10 (bin) and another (low, -1).


The fans shouted: WOW (up) , that incredible (cap, 4) !!


Start with some simple text (cap, 2) but then try (cap, 10000 nested text (low, 500)) to break things.



Punctuation needs fixing ,don't you think? And what about groupings like ... or !!?



The message said: 'the system is critical: reboot NOW (low) and initiate (up, 3) emergency protocols !!! ?'
